# MinesweeperTest
 # MinesweeperTest  This is a Minesweeper clone developed as part of a Unity Developer test assignment.   I recommend starting by exploring the EntryPoint script and following the game flow through method calls.  **Unity version used:** 2022.3.19f1     ## Features  - Customizable field size and mine count (configured via MinesweeperConfig in Data folder). - First click is always safe. - Left-click to reveal a cell, right-click to place a flag. - Recursive reveal of empty cells with no neighboring mines. - Game-over panel with restart button (can also restart the game by pressing a hotkey). - Win condition: reveal all safe cells without triggering a mine. - When the game ends:   - On loss: all mines are revealed, with the exploded mine highlighted.   - On win: all mines are revealed as flagged.  ## Architectural Solutions  - **EntryPoint** pattern for centralized game initialization and control. - **Zenject** is used for dependency injection to improve modularity and testability. - **Mediator** pattern to decouple the game logic (Minefield) from the UI (TilemapView, GameResultView). - **Factory** pattern to create different types of cells (empty, mine, numbered).    ## Controls  - **Left Mouse Button** – Reveal a cell. - **Right Mouse Button** – Place or remove a flag. - **R Key** – Restart the game.  ## Packages Used  - **Zenject** – Dependency Injection Framework.   - **TextMeshPro** – For rendering UI text.  Enjoy!
